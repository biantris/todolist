# Todo-List
Well, the project that will be presented is very simple, but served to consolidate basic knowledge about React, I chose to use typescript, because the code becomes more readable and simple, but if you prefer you can use normal javascript.

## The project will use:

- Typescript
- React Hooks
- Material UI

## Getting Started
**1-** Clone repository.

**2-** Install dependecies.
```js
yarn
// or
yarn install
// and
yarn start
```
